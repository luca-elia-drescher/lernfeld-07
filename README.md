# Lernfeld 07 - Microcontroller & Embedded Systems

This repository contains various projects and code examples related to microcontrollers and embedded systems development using Arduino, ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi.

## Structure

### 1. Arduino 
The `/arduino` folder contains projects and sketches for the Arduino microcontroller. These projects demonstrate basic and advanced functionalities, including sensor integration, motor control, and communication protocols.

### 2. ESP (ESP8266/ESP32)
The `/esp` folder includes projects for ESP8266 and ESP32 boards. These projects cover topics such as WiFi connectivity, IoT applications, MQTT, and web servers.

### 3. Raspberry Pi
The `/raspberry-pi` folder contains scripts and programs designed for the Raspberry Pi. 

## Requirements
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for Arduino projects
- [ESP8266/ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) for ESP projects
- [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and Python for Raspberry Pi scripts
